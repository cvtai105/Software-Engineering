1. Requirements Gathering
    Functional Requirements: Define what the system should do. These are specific tasks like user authentication, file storage, etc.
    Non-functional Requirements (NFRs): Define system performance, scalability, availability, latency, etc. For example:
    Scalability: Ability to handle growth in users or data.
    Reliability: Ensures uptime and minimal downtime.
    Latency: Response time of the system.
    Consistency vs. Availability: Trade-offs between data accuracy and system availability.
2. High-Level Design
    Define the Architecture: Choose between Monolithic, Microservices, Event-Driven, or Serverless architectures.
    Identify Key Components: For example, databases, load balancers, caching layers, queues, or third-party integrations.
    Create a Basic Diagram: Show data flow, components, and how they interact. Diagrams include clients, servers, databases, queues, and APIs.
3. Component Design
    Database Design:
        Choose the right database: SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for structured data with complex queries, or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) for flexibility and scalability.
        Consider replication and partitioning strategies for scalability.
    API Design:
        Design APIs for interactions. REST, GraphQL, and gRPC are common choices.
        Define endpoints, data formats (e.g., JSON), and access controls.
    Caching Layer:
        Add caching to reduce load on the database and speed up responses (e.g., Redis or Memcached).
        Define what data is cacheable, and where to place caches (in-memory, distributed, etc.).
    Load Balancing:
        Distribute incoming requests across multiple servers for improved performance and fault tolerance.
        Use round-robin, IP hash, or least-connections load balancing algorithms.
    Queues and Stream Processing:
        Use queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for decoupling services and managing high-load asynchronous processing.
4. Scalability and Redundancy
    Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling:
        Horizontal scaling adds more servers, while vertical scaling upgrades server capacity.
    Redundancy: Duplicate resources to handle failures. For instance, multi-region setups for critical systems.
    Data Partitioning (Sharding): Split data across multiple servers to balance load.
5. Database Management
    Replication: Improve data availability by duplicating data across servers.
    Sharding: Split the database into smaller parts (shards) to handle large datasets.
    Backups: Regularly backup data to recover from disasters.
6. Monitoring and Logging
    Implement monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track the health and performance of the system.
    Use logging (e.g., ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to track issues and analyze traffic patterns.
7. Security
    Authentication and Authorization: Secure user access with OAuth, JWT tokens, etc.
    Data Encryption: Use HTTPS, SSL/TLS for data in transit and encryption for data at rest.
    Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse by limiting requests per user/IP.
8. Load Testing and Optimization
    Test the System: Simulate high-load scenarios to identify bottlenecks.
    Optimize Components: Tune database queries, cache results, reduce API latency, etc.
